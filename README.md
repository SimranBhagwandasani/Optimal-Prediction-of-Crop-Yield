# Optimal-Prediction-of-Crop-Yield

The system proposes to predict the yield of a crop as per the area of the land fed as input in the Android App, while considering the location parameters (Latitude and Longitude) and weather parameters like season, rainfall, precipitation, area, elevation, minimum and maximum temperature, wind, relative humidity and solar energy. It is an Android app with a Firebase Database connected to a Flask Server and analysis has been done using RStudio. 

I also presented a research paper based on this project, the link for which is mentioned here : https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-15-7421-4_8
